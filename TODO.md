# Models

## Auto-Regressive
- Theta (https://robjhyndman.com/papers/Theta.pdf)

## Regressive
- vanilla RNN
- LSTM
- Gaussian process (http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/chapters/RW2.pdf)
- Quantile regression forest


# Useful TimeSeries

The following could be useful TimeSeries to regress over:
- Indicator variable for holidays (1 during holidays 0 else)
- TimeSeries filled with values linearly increasing over time
- Constant TimeSeries
- Indicator for quarters
